**Students Performance Analysis**
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data to understand the factors influencing academic outcomes. It utilizes a dataset containing various demographic and academic attributes of students, including their scores in math, reading, and writing.

**Key Features:**
Data Loading and Exploration: The project begins by loading and displaying the Students_Performance.csv dataset.
Data Analysis: It involves exploring the relationships between different features (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course) and student scores.
Machine Learning (Potential): Given the imported libraries like sklearn (specifically DecisionTreeClassifier, accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix), the project likely builds and evaluates a machine learning model to predict or classify student performance based on the identified factors.
Visualization: The use of matplotlib and seaborn suggests that the project incorporates data visualization to present insights and trends within the student performance data.
**Technologies Used:**
Python
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn for machine learning model development and evaluation (e.g., DecisionTreeClassifier)
