**YouTube Comment Fetcher with NLP Sentiment Analysis**
This project is a Python-based tool designed to extract comments from YouTube videos and then apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on these comments.

**Project Overview:**
YouTube Comment Extraction: The core functionality involves fetching comments from specified YouTube videos.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Once comments are extracted, NLP techniques are used to process the text data.
Sentiment Analysis: The processed comments are then analyzed to determine the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) expressed by users.
**Potential Applications:**
Understanding public opinion or audience reaction to YouTube content.
Identifying trends and common themes in video comments.
Market research or content strategy insights.
**Technologies Used:**
Python
(Likely) Libraries for interacting with the YouTube Data API (e.g., google-api-python-client)
(Likely) NLP libraries for text processing and sentiment analysis (e.g., NLTK, TextBlob, spaCy, VADER, transformers)
